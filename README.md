# CMS
CMS system developed with PHP, MYSQL Y BOOTSTRAP during the Web development Course in 2018 ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )

To install the project just clone the repository, go to the setup folder and execute the script script.sql with workbench or any app of your preference to create 
the DB tables.
The second step is to create the user of the CMS in the DB to be able to login and start creating articles.
This CMS is intended to be used by administrators, any added user will have full rights to make changes.

Thanks for coming.
